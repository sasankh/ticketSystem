1) Used  MEAN stack.

2)There is a 'test' mongodbdump in the 'db' folder. Perforem a 'monogrestore' of the 'test' database.

3) Perform "npm install".

4) Enter gmail 'email' and 'password' in "function_modules/sendEmail.js" and 'function_modules/getEmail.js' to allow sending and receiving email.

5) Start application from terminal. command : "node server.js" or "nodemon server.js"

6) There is a default user "theforce" with password "maytheforcebewithyou". You can create new admin and use them. Currently the password is placed in plane text and is not encrypted. SSL is there but is commented out. The key and certificate is in 'sslKey'.Implementing ssl may cause "css" error right now but I will fix them later. Encryption and ssl will be implemented in the end product.
